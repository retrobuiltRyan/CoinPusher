You're looking at the revised Coin Pusher. This is version two which addressed some deficiencies in the initial release. First off, now you can pick how you want to drive the coin dozer. There are three options: hand crank, standard size servo, stepper motor. Other 'features':


1) The front was redesigned to accommodate a continuous hinge. And finally a section on top allow for the easy install of a LCD screen.
2) There are now cavities under the coin floor that capture and hold coins won by the 'house' slots. No more loose coins shifting around where electronics are mounted.
3) More captive nut points where added to the inner body frame. This helps pull the side panel in and stiffens of the body.
4) Coin 'plinko' area was fixed to prevent coins from getting stuck on the outer left and right sides.
5) The overall footprint was reduced by 0.75" making it fit in standard boxes.

6) Rewrote code to use interrupts and drive servo.
7) How to Assemble:
